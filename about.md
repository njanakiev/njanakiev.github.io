Hello, I am a freelance data scientist and data engineer. I graduated as a Master of Science in Applied Image and Signal Processing studying in Austria, France, and the United States and I am currently based in Austria. I am interested and working in various areas spanning from data analysis and data visualization over to geospatial analysis and linked data with a strong focus on Python. I also have a [passion](https://parametriccookie.tumblr.com/) for geometric modeling and computational design with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) which I follow up from time to time. This blog is dedicated to some of the topics and interests I like to explore and find valuable.

## Services
I offer various freelancing services and project collaborations in the fields of:

- Building Data Pipelines
- Data Science and Analytics
- Geospatial Processing and Data Analytics
- Python Software Development
- Data Visualizations and Reporting
- Building Dashboards

Previous clients include [_Roam Coliving_ (NY, USA)](https://www.roam.co/) where I was building the data pipeline and dashboards for real estate analytics working with geospatial data on a large scale using Python. For [_Riser GmbH_ (Vienna, AT)](http://riserapp.com/) I worked on improving the routing by analyzing street networks in OpenStreetMap, creating custom routing profiles for [GraphHopper](http://graphhopper.com/) and implementing a data pipeline and dashboard.
